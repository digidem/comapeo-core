    # When this workflow is triggered by workflow_dispatch, the optic release
    # action will create the release PR targeting the branch that the workflow
    # is dispatched from.
    #
    # We only run this job when it's triggered by workflow_dispatch targeting
    # the default branch, unless it's a prerelease, where we allow releases
    # against branches other than the default. This is to ensure that actual
    # releases tag commits on the main branch, to avoid confusion about where a
    # release has come from.
    #
    # The workflow also runs when either a PR is closed or merged (the `types:
    # [closed]` triggers this on both). We skip this job on PRs by authors other
    # than optic-release-automation[bot]. When a PR is merged, the bot will
    # publish the release to npm. When it's closed, the bot will delete the
    # draft release that's created when the PR is opened.
